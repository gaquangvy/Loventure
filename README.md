# Loventure

This project is from CS 4990 in Summer 2020 at Cal Poly Pomona and taught by Dr. Yu Sun. It is Flutter's Development and allows using Dart programming (Java-base) and Flutter modules. I created this project by my idea but still under the instuction from Dr Yu Sun.

## Getting Started

The project's objects are to measure time, save pictures and stories, and remind an event for user. I would like to develop this project that the application can socialize like Facebook and Instagram.
